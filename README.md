# Marking-word-game-using-Python
When a player finds a word, they usually mark it by circling or highlighting the letters that form the word.
It looks like you've successfully implemented the "Marking Words" game in Python. The program generates a grid of random letters and prompts the player to mark words by inputting starting and ending coordinates. If the coordinates are valid, the program extracts the marked word and displays it.

Here are a few suggestions for further improvements or modifications:

1. **Scoring System:** You could implement a scoring system based on the difficulty of finding words or the length of marked words.

2. **Multiple Rounds:** Allow the player to play multiple rounds with different grids and words.

3. **Timer:** Add a timer to see how quickly the player can find all the words.

4. **Word List:** Instead of generating random letters, you could provide a predefined list of words for the player to find.
